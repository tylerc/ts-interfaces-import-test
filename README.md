ts-interfaces-import-test
=========================

What is this?
-------------

This is a test repo that imports a TypeScript interface from NPM.

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

And then compile TypeScript code with:

```
tsc
```

You should get no errors.

You can then run the program if you'd like to (it doesn't do much):

```
node index.js
```

Why?
----

I saw this question on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/bcaqi0/sharing_types_with_team/

And thought it would be something interesting to try out, and maybe I could answer their question in the process.
